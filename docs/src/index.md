# WaveguideQED.jl

WaveguideQED.jl is a package for simulating continuous fockstates in waveguides. It expands on [`QuantumOptics.jl`](https://qojulia.org/) by adding a custom basis and operators for efficiently representing time-binned photon states. 

## Citing
If you find the package usefull in your research. Please consider citing: [https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2025-04-17-1710/](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2025-04-17-1710/).


## Dev docs
Added functionalities:
* [`WaveguideBasis`](@ref) for representing the waveguide Hilbert space and the related functions for generating states in this Hilbert space: [`zerophoton`](@ref), [`onephoton`](@ref), and [`twophoton`](@ref). Also see [`OnePhotonView`](@ref), [`TwoPhotonView`](@ref), and [`plot_twophoton!`](@ref) for viewing the waveguide states and plotting them. Note that [`WaveguideBasis`](@ref) can contain multiple waveguides.
* [`WaveguideOperator`](@ref) are specialized operators allowing efficient annihilation and creation operators at each time-bin in the waveguide. They are created by giving a basis to [`WaveguideQED.destroy`](@ref) and [`WaveguideQED.create`](@ref)
* Since the interaction between the waveguide time-bin mode $k$ and cavity/emitter is given as: $a^\dagger w_k - a w_k^\dagger$ there are specially optimized functions for doing these operations called [`CavityWaveguideOperator`](@ref) which are created using a fockbasis and a waveguide basis and the functions [`emission`](@ref) and [`absorption`](@ref).
* (OBSOLETE. SEE [Beamsplitter](@ref Beamsplitter_docs) INSTEAD). [`Detector`](@ref), [`LazyTensorKet`](@ref), and [`LazySumKet`](@ref), together with [`detect_single_click`](@ref) and [`detect_double_click`](@ref) allow one to do a beamsplitter interference and subsequent detection of photons coming from two waveguides.
